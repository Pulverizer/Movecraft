# Movecraft-for-Sponge
<pre>
After the Bukkit DMCA and the death of Cauldron I missed the ability to fly airships around my modded worlds.


The aim of this project is to rectify this problem by porting Movecraft to the Sponge API.
Some additional features are being added as a part of this process.
